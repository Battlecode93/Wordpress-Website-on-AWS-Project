README: Highly Available 3-Tier WordPress Web Application on AWS

Project Overview

This repository documents the implementation of a highly available 3-tier architecture for a WordPress web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project encompasses the creation of a resilient network, a high availability data tier using Amazon RDS and ElastiCache, and a scalable application tier with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities.

Architecture

Network Setup
VPC Creation: Created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) named "Wordpress-VPC."
Subnet Configuration: Established 6 subnets across two availability zones: 2 Public, 2 Application, and 2 Data.
Internet Gateway: Attached an Internet Gateway to the Wordpress VPC.
Gateways and Routing: Created two Gateways (one for each public subnet A and B) and configured route tables for Application subnets using NAT gateways as the default gateway. Associated the route tables with both Application subnets.
High Availability Data Tier
Amazon RDS

Security Groups: Created two security groupsâ€”one for the client database and another for the main database.
Inbound Rules: Edited inbound rules for the main database to allow traffic from the client database security group.
RDS Subnet Group: Formed an RDS subnet group to specify subnets for database deployment.
Aurora Database Cluster: Created an Aurora database cluster connected to the VPC and DB subnet group.
Amazon ElastiCache

Cache Security Groups: Established cache security groups for the cache client and the main cache.
Inbound Traffic Rules: Modified inbound traffic rules for the main cache to allow traffic from the cache client security group.
Memcached Configuration: Configured an ElastiCache Memcached instance, adding a subnet group consisting of Data A and Data B, along with the main cache security group.
Amazon EFS

Filesystem Security Groups: Made filesystem security groups for Elastic Filesystem (EFS).
Inbound Rules: Edited inbound rules for traffic coming from the FS client security group to the main FS security group.
EFS Cluster: Configured an EFS cluster, mounting the two Application subnets (A and B) in each availability zone.
Application Tier
Load Balancer

Load Balancer Security Group: Created a load balancer security group, allowing HTTP traffic on port 80 only from a specified IP.
Configuration: Configured a load balancer to distribute application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances in different availability zones.
Launch Template

WordPress Servers Security Group: Created a security group for WordPress servers, allowing HTTP traffic on port 80 only from the Load Balancer security group.
Launch Template: Configured a launch template for Auto Scaling Groups, including a custom user data script with EFS, DB name, host, DB username, DB password, and the load balancer. Also included 4 security groups in the launch template: WP cache client, WP DB client, WP EFS client, and WP WordPress.
App Server Auto Scaling Group

Auto Scaling Group: Created an Auto Scaling Group to automatically scale the number of WordPress application servers based on traffic.
Access: Accessed the WordPress installation site through the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer.
Summary

This project utilized AWS services to create a highly available, distributed, and fault-tolerant web application. Key achievements include:

AWS VPC: A software-defined network across multiple AWS availability zones.
Amazon RDS: Managed active/standby multi-node MySQL database deployment with automatic backups and recovery.
Amazon ElastiCache: Memcached-powered cache to reduce database queries against the HA MySQL database.
Amazon EFS: Distributed NFS share for sharing a single WordPress installation across multiple application servers.
AWS Auto Scaling and Application Load Balancer: Ensures a dynamic and scalable infrastructure based on resource utilization and user traffic.
The demonstrated pattern in this project can be adapted for various web application technologies where state can be externalized to a filesystem, cache, or database.
